# Donald Trump's personality assesment with Twitter and IBM Watson

Much has been written about **Donald Trump**â€™s character concerning his **fitness for office** but very little of it was grounded in science. 

By building on previous research to label the data and leveraging IBM's Personality Insight API, this analysis of Trump's Twitter communications will allow us to gain **unbiased insights** into Donald J. Trump's personality as well as **his mindset during the 2016 presidential election.**

## Data 
The data was provided by Brendan Brown's Trump Twitter Archive and spanded from 2009 to 2020.
